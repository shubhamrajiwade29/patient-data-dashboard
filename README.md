🏥 Patient Healthcare Data Dashboard

An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing patient demographics, healthcare encounters, and data quality metrics using synthetic healthcare data. Built to demonstrate data visualization, healthcare analytics, and data quality monitoring skills.

📊 Dashboard Overview
This dashboard provides comprehensive insights into patient populations and healthcare utilization patterns through four analytical views:
1. Demographics Analysis (Gender Dist, Race, Age Dist)

Gender Distribution: 5,125 female patients vs 4,875 male patients (51.2% vs 48.8%)
Race Distribution: Majority White patients (3,340), followed by Black/African American (730), Other (710), Asian (287), and American Indian/Alaska Native (58)
Age Distribution: Birth year analysis showing patient concentration from 1930s-1960s, with peak volumes in mid-20th century

2. Healthcare Encounters Over Time

Trend Analysis: Exponential growth in patient encounters from 1914 (~1 encounter) to 2014 (8,774 encounters)
Growth Phases: Flat baseline (1914-1960s), gradual increase (1970s-1990s), sharp acceleration (2000-2014)
Top Encounter Codes:

Code 185347001: 275,483 encounters
Code 439740005: 185,048 encounters
Code 162673000: 123,095 encounters

3. Top Encounter Codes

Visualizes the 10 most frequent medical procedure/diagnosis codes
Helps identify most common patient care needs and resource allocation patterns

4. Data Quality Dashboard

Total Violations: 217 data quality issues identified
Rule Checks: 5 validation rules monitored
Primary Issue: AGE_OUT_OF_RANGE violations (217 instances)
Data Completeness: 0 missing values for gender, race, and start date fields

🎯 Key Insights & Business Value
Demographics

Slight female patient majority may inform gender-specific care programs
Racial diversity present but with significant White patient concentration (47% of population)
Age distribution suggests need for geriatric care focus (birth years concentrated 1930-1960)

Healthcare Utilization

140x increase in encounters from 1990 (417) to 2014 (8,774) indicates either population growth, improved record-keeping, or increased healthcare access
Top encounter code represents 33% of all encounters—potential area for efficiency improvements or specialized care protocols

Data Quality

99.98% data quality rate (217 violations out of ~10,000 patients)
Age validation rules caught 217 outliers—demonstrates proactive data governance
Zero missing values in critical demographic fields shows strong data collection practices

🔍 Analytical Approach

Data Exploration: Profiled patient dataset to understand structure, distributions, and data quality issues
Metric Selection: Identified key healthcare KPIs (patient volume, encounter frequency, demographic breakdowns)
Visualization Design: Created clear, interpretable charts following healthcare analytics best practices
Data Quality Focus: Built dedicated monitoring view to flag anomalies and missing data
Storytelling: Structured dashboard to flow from demographics → utilization → data validation

💡 Potential Applications
This dashboard framework could be adapted for:

Hospital Operations: Monitor admission patterns and resource allocation
Public Health: Track population health trends and intervention effectiveness
Healthcare Policy: Analyze demographic disparities in care access
Quality Assurance: Real-time data quality monitoring for EHR systems
